While basic SQL commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are suitable for many common use cases, advanced techniques can enable more complex queries and analyses. In this guide, we will explore some of the most popular advanced SQL techniques with a focus on Spring GDP Hong Kong's e-commerce solution sales and finance."
